This project will build a multicore microcontroller consisting of 8 RISC-V 32
bit cores which are running synchronous, each with it's own small RAM. It is
inspired by the basic concept of the Propeller (P1) from Parallax but uses a new
designed memory architecture which is configurable in several modes.
See the doc directory for more details.
